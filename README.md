# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is called "around the U.S.". It is made to practice creating a profile page and making sure all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
I had to make sure that the profile page itself did not break while testing it on differnet display resolutions.We were given an overview of what our outcome should be once we are finished. Using different tools such as grid,flex and media, I had to make sure the finsihed product was close as possible to the overview.You can find the overview we were given below in with the figma link.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
